=====

Adzmo is a Rails app I built in 2006. Adzmo was a location shopping tool before smart phones and GPS. It allowed a user to send a txt message or email to [category]@adzmo.com with the telephone number of any nearby store in the body of the message and where category was a product or service they were interested in. The app would look up the telephone number provided in the body, do a reverse lookup, find the address to determine location, then do a local search on Yahoo based on that location and the category of merchant and finally return the results of that search back to the user.
